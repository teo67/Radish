# = can be appended to any operator in order to shorten variable assignment! #
# for example... #
dig a plant 0
a += 3 # now a is 3 #
a /= 2 # now it's 1.5 #
a !== 2 # now it's true (yes) #
a &&= no # now false #
a == no # true again #
# ... etcetera. This also applies to bitwise and boolean comparators. #

# increment and decrement shortcuts #
dig b plant 0
b++ # add 1 #
b-- # subtract 1 #
